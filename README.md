# Bidirectional ClickHouse & Flat File Data Ingestion Tool

This is a web-based application that facilitates bidirectional data ingestion between ClickHouse and flat files (CSV). The tool allows users to easily ingest data from ClickHouse to flat files and vice versa, while handling JWT token-based authentication for secure access to ClickHouse. Users can select columns for ingestion, view progress, and receive completion reports.
